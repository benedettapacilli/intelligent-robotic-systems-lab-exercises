# Intelligent Robotic Systems Lab Exercises

This repository contains exercises for the **Intelligent Robotic Systems** course, part of the Master's program in **Computer Science and Engineering - Intelligent Embedded Systems** at the University of Bologna.

## Contents
- **Lab 01: Simple Behaviors with ARGoS**  
  Phototaxis and obstacle avoidance programming using proximity and light sensors in a controlled arena.
  
- **Lab 02: Composite Behaviors**  
  Combining basic behaviors to reach a light source while avoiding obstacles, and testing in different environments.

- **Lab 03: Subsumption Architecture**  
  Task-based behavior using subsumption architecture, with light detection and obstacle avoidance using a layered approach.

- **Lab 04: Motor Schemas in ARGoS**  
  Implementing behavior-based control for light-seeking and obstacle avoidance with vector-based motor schemas.

- **Lab 05: Swarm Robotics**  
  Exploring aggregation behaviors using probabilistic automata for swarm robots, including random walk, stopping, and leaving rules.

- **Lab 06: Thymio Robots and Aseba Programming**  
  Programming Thymio robots for wandering and collision avoidance, using an event-based architecture with Aseba language.
